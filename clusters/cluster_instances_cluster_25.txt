Job Title: Senior Operating Systems Engineer
Job Description: Openchip is a European Silicon Engineering Company, headquartered in Barcelona, Spain. We aim to democratize the usage of Chips by developing Systems on Chip, SOCs, that combines RISC-V and accelerated chiplets for AI and HPC, everything interconnected with UCIe open interfaces. Our technologies will provide a value in multiple fields as Artificial Intelligence, Security and Privacy and Carbon Footprint Reduction. We are willing to change the Silicon Industry and help to build a more sustainable world, where collaboration and openness are by default. Our chips will be used in High Performance Computing, Autonomous Driving, Telecommunications, Personalized Medicine, Edge Computing and Cloud.

We are looking for outstanding people willing to join our mission to change this industry and help to build a better world.

We can offer you an exciting and accelerated career path in a multicultural and multinational environment where innovation, teamwork and trust are in our DNA. You will have the opportunity to learn from senior professionals, use the most advanced technologies to develop chips and participate in one of the most relevant technological projects in the European Union.



We are actively seeking a Senior Operating Systems Engineer to join our dynamic and growing software team.



The Role:

Develop low- (BIOS, firmware, device drivers) and mid-level software (emulation, simulation, and virtualization; monitoring, telemetry, and control middleware) to enable the use of Company U1’s novel hardware features and accelerators, bringing visible improvements to end users.



Responsibilities:

Make independent technical contributions to help their team deliver its commitments. In particular:
Develop and maintain low-level software (BIOS and firmware) for novel hardware architectures.
Develop and maintain device drivers for operating systems (mainly Linux) to expose novel hardware features (e.g., telemetry) and acceleration, as well as to support their emulation and virtualization.
Provide monitoring, instrumentation, and telemetry to export system status and health metrics.
Provide workload control and configuration, and API entry points to allow remote operation.
Configure and extend emulation, simulation, and virtualization software
Interact with ICs from their and other projects to unblock themself, or to reach consensus on small technical topics. In particular:
Work with hardware teams, influencing hardware/software co-design.
Work with teams developing middleware, and/or contribute to middleware.
Collaborate with colleagues through code reviews, bug triaging, design documents, …
Contribute to shared team responsibilities (CI failure triaging, documentation, code fixits, rotations...).


Qualifications:

Bachelor or Master’s degree in a relevant field.
Experience in the relevant field (3-5yr).
Experience with low-level development languages (C, Rust).
Experience with assembly language (of any architecture).
Languages: C, C++, Python, Rust
Passion for technology and a strong desire to contribute to the success of a growing startup.


Would be a plus the next qualification:

Experience with RISC-V development at the assembly-language level.
Experience with the Python programming language.
Experience with device driver development.
Experience with bare metal (without OS) development (e.g., embedded systems, microcontrollers).
Experience with container technology (Docker, Kubernetes).
Experience with virtualization technology (KVM, Xen).
Experience with emulators (QEmu, Spike)
The person should be located in Barcelona or nearby.


Soft skills

We are looking for team players that focus on the outcome of the team above the individual needs, with respect and honest challenge.
Within- and cross-team collaboration at the technical level.
The ideal candidate should count with a “can do attitude”, willing to solve any obstacle by himself. Self-starter and self-motivated.
