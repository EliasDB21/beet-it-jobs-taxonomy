Job Title: Researcher in Applied Mathematics & Plasma Physics 
Job Description: What You Will Do

We are looking for candidates to join our team in Company W8's Theoretical Division. Our division provides a unique and engaging environment that fosters multi-disciplinary collaborations to support the laboratory's strategic basic research and national security missions. The Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics  group within our division conducts research in novel algorithms and numerical methods for a variety of applications including fusion science, space plasma science, astrophysics, numerical analysis, machine learning, computational imaging, optimization, artificial intelligence, environmental sciences, and the modeling of critical infrastructure (gas pipelines and electrical grids).

The project will explore the development of particle (Lagrangian) and low-rank mesh-based (Eulerian) approaches to solve the kinetic plasma model equations, while overcoming the curse of dimensionality. The methods developed will be used to simulate high-temperature plasmas for space physics, astrophysics, and laboratory fusion applications. Depending on the interests and skills of the successful candidate, the research may focus on numerical algorithm development, or its application to model plasma phenomena in fusion or space physics, such as magnetic reconnection, plasma shocks and other plasma instabilities.

A background in either applied mathematics or plasma physics is desired and the selected candidate is expected to work within a small team of applied mathematicians and plasma physicists. 

What You Need

Minimum Job Requirements:

Demonstrated ability to publish in scientific journals, and to communicate effectively, both written and orally. 
Ability to collaborate effectively in a team environment, and develop solutions for complex problems while effectively networking with peers. 
Experience in developing and/or applying Lagrangian or Eulerian methods to solve partial differential equations. 
Proficiency in C/C++, Python, Julia, Fortran and/or MATLAB. 

Education/Experience: A Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics, Plasma Physics, Astrophysics, Engineering, Computational Science, or a closely related field completed within the past five years or soon to be completed.

Desired Qualifications:

Expertise in theoretical or computational plasma physics, space physics, and/or astrophysics. 
Experience with particle-in-cell methods or low-rank tensor decomposition methods. 
Experience with parallel numerical algorithm development and simulation on modern computer architectures. 
Experience with code development relevant to computational physics.
