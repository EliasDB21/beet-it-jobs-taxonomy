# BEET: A Comprehensive Taxonomy for IT Job Classification

BEET (Bee-inspired Employment and Expertise Taxonomy) is a hierarchical framework designed to classify IT jobs within the ISCO-08 structure. It provides a structured and precise classification system that helps categorize IT roles, forecast workforce demands, and guide educators in preparing professionals for Industry 5.0.

## Why BEET?

The IT sector is rapidly evolving, and existing classification systems, such as ISCO-08, lack the necessary granularity for IT job roles. BEET addresses this gap by introducing:

- A hierarchical structure with 5 major groups, 15 sub-major groups, and 35 unit groups as shown in Figure 1.

- A focus on hard skills and seniority levels.

- A data-driven approach based on global IT job postings (2023-2025).

## Applications

BEET is designed to support various stakeholders in the IT job market, including:

- HR Professionals: Align applicants with job opportunities more effectively.

- Workforce Analysts: Forecast labor market trends and IT job demands.

- Educators: Structure training programs aligned with Industry 5.0 needs.
